# Block2Project

This public repository's purpose is to display my senior capstone course's project. Automated Auto Care (AAC) is a mobile app project I and 3 other students developed over the course of a year as a means to automate the process of updating and notifying you when repairs are due for your car. This public repository shows the inner workings of such project.
